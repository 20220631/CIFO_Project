# CIFO_Project

Intro
------
The projects suggested below are all expected to be solved using the Charles Genetic Algorithm
Library developed throughout the semester. If you prefer to create your own library from scratch,
you are free to do so. If you decide to undertake a more complex custom problem, you are free
to use external GA libraries - although the library developed in class should be solid enough for
any GA use-case.
Everyone is expected to demonstrate a good understanding of optimization problems and GAs.
These are demonstrated by representing your problem well pragmatically, both as the
representation itself as well as the definition of your fitness function. Keep in mind that the
simpler the project the more implementations you are expected to do.
These are some basic steps expected from each project:

Implement several selection methods

Implement several mutation operators

Implement several crossover operators


Illustrate and compare the performance of different approaches to your problem in your report.
The report should focus exclusively on your implementation and the results you obtained, hence,
have no literature review or “Introduction to CIFO/ Genetic Algorithms” part. It should only focus
on your project.
Try to illustrate decisions taken both in written form as well as using plots and illustrations. Your
decisions should be based on statistical validation (i.e. run each selected configuration 100 times
and compare the performance of your different configurations statistically)

Stiglers Diet
---------------
Utilize GAs to evolve solutions for Stigler's Diet Problem, which is named after the Nobel laureate
in economics, George Stigler. Stigler devised an economical method to satisfy fundamental
nutritional requirements based on a specified set of foods. The primary aim is to minimize the
overall cost while satisfying the nutritional requirements. The dataset for this problem is available
here: https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp/stigler_diet, but you can increase the
number of foods, nutritional requirements, and constraints, as well as introduce uncertainty to
modify the problem's complexity and facilitate comparisons.
